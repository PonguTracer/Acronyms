# 27.1 LAB: Acronyms

An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of words in a set phrase. Write a program whose input is a phrase and whose output is an acronym of the input. Append a period (.) after each letter in the acronym. If a word begins with a lower case letter, don't include that letter in the acronym. Assume the input has at least one upper case letter.
